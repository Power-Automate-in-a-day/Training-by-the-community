# Welcome to Power Automate in a Day training - 2025
This is the Power Automate in a day v10 material (last update : March 2025, by Serge Luca - aka "Doctor Flow" (from ShareQL.com)  
- v1 was created in July 2018.  
- 9 versions have been created since 2018.
- Starting in 2025, we began recording the content in videos uploaded to YouTube. Here is the link to the [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bynK8hlylM&list=PL6oVinAUc710j7KwOxQUvAXZACagc2k-Y).
- Don't forget to download the resources for the labs, we minimized the number of resource files you need to follow the labs.  
- Some labs require a premium licence, in lab 8 we show you how to create a Developer environment and get a free premium license.  
- Don't hesitate to report any typo, error, suggestion in the "issues" part of the site.  
- This is a community project we are volunteers and we do that on our free time.
